## Automated Testing

### W3C Validator
####  *HTML*

W3C was used to validate the HTML of the ROCHAMBEAU! site. I  checked the HTML via direct input and also by copying the page source and running these through the validator.

![W3C HTML validation](doc/readme-images/html2.jpg)

*several info messages popped up these are caused by the formatting and are unable to be removed.

---

#### *CSS*
CSS Validation can only be done by copying and pasting the CSS file contents into the direct input.

## JSHint
### *Javascript*
JSHint is a program that flags suspicious usage in programs written in JavaScript. 

![JSHint Validation](doc/readme-images/jshint.jpg)

These variables are used, but the program had a hard time understanding that due to the structure of the textNodes.

## Manual testing

Some of the website functions needed to be tested manually, namely the game its self.

#### Fixed Bugs
Forgot to make sure the eye shows up in player's inventory after killing the alchemist, fixed this pretty simply
Fixed an issue where a forgotten quotation-mark was preventing the secret ending's text from being read

#### Known bugs
If the player clicks too fast through the options, the inventory system will not work. This is relatively small, since this game is based on reading, but if a player is zooming through the onclick events won't have time to catch up.
