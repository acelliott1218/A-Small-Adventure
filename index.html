        <p class="landing-text">Press the start button to start your adventure! From there, multiple choices will appear in blue boxes
            <br>
            You'll want to select one of those choices to progress the story. Choices have consequences, obviously, but if you ever reach a point
            <br>
            where there's no way to continue the story, the game will restart from the beginning! Feel free to restart as many times as you like
            <br>
             -- in fact I encourage you to explore all the possible endings!
